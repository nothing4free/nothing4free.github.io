# A little update.
Hello, friends.
It's been a long, long while since the last activity in here (I believe 2 years ago!). A lot of things have changed, mostly for the better. First of all, I graduated, so I can officially say I'm a Software Engineer with a specialty in cybersecurity! Job-wise, I am now 2 years deep into what's been my first cybersecurity job as an Offensive Security Engineer @ SilentForce, and I also started a job as an university teacher @ U-tad. It's being pretty damn demanding so far, but hey, a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor, am I right? I also joined the cultural organization at RootedCON, which is being great so far! The team there is one of the nicest I've ever had the opportunity to work with and the Madrid edition this year was incredible.

I'm quite happy with how things are turning out so far, and as I said, even though this is being very, very demanding, I'm excited to see what's next. I would love to post more stuff in here, and that's one of the things I have in mind for the future. This is no dead project, nor has ever been. I want to start documenting some of the stuff I do: my research, my scripts, and anything I feel that can contribute to the infosec community.

That's pretty much it, friends. I'll keep you all updated on the n4free project ;)

Untill then, take care!
