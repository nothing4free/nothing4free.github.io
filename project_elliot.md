# /project-elliot

Project Elliot is a purpose-built computer I'm currently working on. It is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 that runs a custom wired and wireless networks pentesting framework I'm also developing. This cyberdeck also has dedicated hardware for these purposes that, together with a screen and keyboard, will be neatly packaged in a Commodore 64C.

Project Elliot is just a codename/placeholder for this cyberdeck, therefore it probably won't be its definitive name. I will post more details about this setup soon, as I'm pretty busy with work and university.

ttyl! :)
